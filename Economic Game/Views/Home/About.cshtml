<p>Today you are going to be playing a buying and selling game for real money. 
    However much you win, will be paid out at the conclusion of the session. 
    You will playing four rounds of this buying and selling game against another person at another location.  
    Each round will be with the same person.  
    Everyone accessing this app is a buyer and everyone accessing the other app is a seller. 
    A buyer is someone who purchases a product or service with the expectation of some type of benefit. 
    A seller is an entity which provides a product or service. 
    Just to recap everyone in this using the app your are accessing is a buyer.
</p>

    In this game you will have the opportunity to buy a financial investment from a seller.
    As a buyer you can choose to invest all, some, or none of the money in the financial investment with the seller.
    If you choose to invest, the amount of money you invest will be multiplied by a set amount provided on the form and given to the seller. 
    The seller will then have the opportunity to return all, some, or none of the money back to you before the next round commences.
    For example if you are playing around where you have $1 to invest and there is a 6X multiplier you can choose to keep the $1 and give nothing to the seller in which case you will receive $1 for this round at the end of the study. 
    If you choose to keep $.50 and give the seller $.50 the seller will receive $.50 multiplied by 6 or $3. 
    The seller can choose to keep the $3, share some of the profit back with you, or keep all the money for themselves. 
    In the scenario if the seller chooses to share half of their $3 with you, you would end up with $1.50 plus the $.50 you and hence you would make $2 total. 
    Given the same scenario where you are given a dollar and there is a 6X multiplier you can choose to give the entire amount to the seller. In this case the seller would receive $6 and they can choose to keep all, some, or none of that money. For example, they could give you back any amount ranging from one penny to the full $6 or any increment in between. 
    Both parties will be awarded money from this split at the end of the game.

    The first round will be a practice round. 
    Please keep in mind that including the practice round there are four rounds total and you will be playing with the same person in each round. 
    If you do not understand any aspects of the game please ask so you can make the most amount of money possible. 
    Your goal is to make the maximum amount of money possible.
